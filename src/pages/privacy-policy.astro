                        We do not collect any personal data. All data created

                            other content you create are stored in your device's internal
                            storage and are encrypted where applicable.

                            locally using on-device AI models (like Whisper) and are
                            never uploaded for transcription.

                            local LLMs. No data is sent to external APIs (like OpenAI
                            or Gemini) unless you explicitly configure a third-party
                            extension (if available in future updates).

                            audio for voice notes and transcription. Audio data is
